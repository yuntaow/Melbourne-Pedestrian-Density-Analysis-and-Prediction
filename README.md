# Melbourne-Pedestrian-Density-Analysis-and-Prediction
Use LSTM deep learning model to predict the pedestrian count in Melbourne CBD.

This my attempt to predict the density of pedestrian in Melbourne CBD. Regarding Euclidean loss, the final LSTM model is 6X better than a Mean model. 

When running this file, you will automatically retrieve data from Pedestrian Counting System (City of Melbourne).

model.h5 is a pre-trained model trained on a GTX1080 graphics card.
